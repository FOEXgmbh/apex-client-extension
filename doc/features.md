Please be very careful when activating any of those features, as giving your APEX application to client resources always has a security impact.

Therefor deactivate all but those really necessary features.

	, "startURL"            : "https://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=APEXCE"
	, "urlBlackList"        : []
	, "exposeClipboard"     : false
	, "exposeDialog"        : false
	, "exposeFs"            : false
	, "exposeGlobalShortcut": false
